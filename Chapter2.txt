a very ugly witch came to him one day. she begged him to resuce her younger sister, who was abducted by local beasts near the beast lake. 
the Hero did not seem to care for her. 
" i heard that you are a great guy, and will help anyone you are Hero , is that what a heroness means?" she asked in contempt.
" how does your sister looks, by the looks of it, she might look just as ugly as you, if not more? " he carelessly cracked a joke at her. everyone starts laughing at his joke. 
" No she looks as ugly as the girls in your small town". saying this she cursed him and she left the place. 
a thick yellow fog sorrounded the town, everyone fell asleep. 
when they woke up, 1 whole day was lost to the entire town, they all slept the for one whole day. 
but the real strangest thing happened is ,when they opened their eyes,they saw every woman in the town were looking as ugly as the witch. if not even more uglier. 
everyone went crazy over this phenomen. 
realizing what mistake he did , he left to seek forgivness from the ugly witch.
